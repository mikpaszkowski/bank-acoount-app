# bank_account_app

> A Vue.js project

## Tech stack

* HTML5 

* CSS3(SCSS) 

* JavaScript

## Overview

The main goal of application was to skill myself in the field of front-end.
The app is making simple bank operations such as deposit/withdraw of money and sending requests
to the other people. (Still in progress) validation of log in/sign up can keep the input data in proper form and within
required statements.
Basing on the transactions of the user we can calculate the blance of the user's cash.
I've made a lot of work from the ZERO of html/css and JavaScript

These application was one of my first with a full usage of HTML/CSS(SCSS).
In the first stage of this app I created only html and css files with scss pre-processor.
Thanks to this app I am still improving my skills in JavaScript.
Finally I've made a usage of the Vue.js framework. I have devided the application into several components
to create known single-page-application.

## Required forward work

* not-fully progressive

* early-stage back-end (data bases, server-side issues, nothing in fact :D)
