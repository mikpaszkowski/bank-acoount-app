# financial-app

> A Vue.js project

## Tech stack

* HTML5 

* CSS3(SCSS) 

* JavaScript

## Overview

The main goal of application was to skill myself in the field of front-end.
The app is making simple bank operations such as deposit/withdraw of money and sending requests
to the other people. (Still in progress) validation of log in/sign up can keep the input data in proper form and within
required statements. Input data will be put directly in the data base (MySQL/MongoDb).
Basing on the transactions of the user we can calculate the blance of the user's cash.
I've made a lot of work from the ZERO of html/css and JavaScript

These application was one of my first with a full usage of HTML/CSS(SCSS).
In the first stage of this app I created only html and css files with scss pre-processor.
Thanks to this app I am still improving my skills in JavaScript.
Finally I've made a usage of the Vue.js framework. I have devided the application into several components
to create known single-page-application.
